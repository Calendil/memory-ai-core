# neural-core

**neural-core** is a modular, GPT-connected bridge API that routes functional logic through clean, isolated endpoints.  
Originally built to handle memory operations, it now expands to support multiple functional integrations like Notion, database operations, and more â€” all exposed to a Custom GPT through OpenAPI actions.
